# Crucis Nexus 227
My personal website!

I am in the process of building a simple static/dynamic page generator, the initial results of that can be found here. This is designed to be build via `build.sh` and automatically generates CSS via Tailwind and cleans the HTML via Tidy. A copy of my `humans.txt` is included as a continual reference to these things and those who have helped me. <3

## Build Requirements
I host this on Ubuntu, so I designed it to be built there
- PHP (7+)
- Tidy (https://www.html-tidy.org/)

## Dependencies
- https://tailwindcss.com/ (Binary download included in build.sh)

## Instructions
- Install PHP
- Install Tidy
- Run `build.sh`
- Enjoy :)
